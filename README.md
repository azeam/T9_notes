## Set up dev env
[Install NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) 

### API:

Run `npm install` from the functions folder  
Run `firebase serve` from the functions folder to start a "local firebase" (will run at port 5000)  

### Client:  
Run `npm install` and `npm start` from the home folder to start local Node server, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
